000 SoText2 won't show with drawstyle == hidden line. Bug reported by
    Jean Davy. Reproduce with this minimal, stand-alone example:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #include <Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h>
    #include <Inventor/Qt/viewers/SoQtExaminerViewer.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoCone.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoSeparator.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoText2.h>
    
    int
    main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
      QWidget * mainwin = SoQt::init(argv[0]);
      SoSeparator * root = new SoSeparator;
    
      root->addChild(new SoCone);
      SoText2 * text2d = new SoText2;
      root->addChild(text2d);
      text2d->string = "tjo-bing";
    
      SoQtExaminerViewer * viewer = new SoQtExaminerViewer(mainwin);
      viewer->setSceneGraph(root);
      viewer->setDrawStyle(SoQtExaminerViewer::STILL,
                           SoQtExaminerViewer::VIEW_HIDDEN_LINE);
    
      SoQt::show(mainwin);
      SoQt::mainLoop();
    
      return 0;
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    This is the cause of the bug, according to <pederb@sim.no>:

      We use GL polygon offset to do hidden line rendering, and this
      caused problems since the SoText2 characters are rendered twice
      (for the first pass we just draw everything black, with an
      z-buffer offset). SoText2 characters are drawn as bitmaps, which
      are not affected by polygon offset.

    Consider this a fairly low priority bug.

001 Using the dolly-wheel of the ExaminerViewer to zoom waaaay out
    eventually leads to error messages and an assert crash.

    This problem was reported for SoWinExaminerViewer, but I can
    reproduce it with the SoQtExaminerViewer, so it's probably a
    common bug for all toolkits.

    The error messages are (many of this)

        Coin warning in SbVec3f::normalize(): The length of the vector should be > 0.0f to be able to normalize.

    and one of this:

        Coin warning in SbBox3f::setBounds(): The box is not valid.

    The assert is:

        examinerviewer: <Coin>/src/base/SbBox3f.cpp:263: void SbBox3f::setBounds(const SbVec3f &, const SbVec3f &): Assertion `0' failed.

002 Should search for and pick up VRML97 Viewpoint nodes.

    As of now, the SoGuiViewer only scans a newly set scene graph for
    SoCamera nodes. (If found, it will "attach" the viewer controls to
    the first one.) If none is found, the viewer sets up it's own in
    it's private "control graph".

    This doesn't work with VRML97 scene graphs, obviously, so
    SoGuiViewer should also scan for Viewpoint nodes to be set up as
    the viewer's camera.

    Note that matters are complicated a bit by the fact that we can't
    be sure that an implementation of any VRML97 nodes is actually
    present in the Coin / Inventor library (it could be SGI Inventor,
    or it could be Coin configured to exclude VRML97 support). So we
    need to search for them by using the SoType::fromName("Viewpoint")
    type (check that this is != SoType::badType() to see whether
    VRML97 is supported), and connect up it's position, orientation
    and fieldOfViewer fields by using the introspection features of
    SoFieldContainer.
