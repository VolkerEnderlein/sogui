WHAT'S THIS?
============

This document describes API extension ideas where we think the So*
libraries lacks necessary functionality.

The listing of an API change or API extension in this file does not
mean that it will be implemented, only that it will be considered for
implementation.

Ideas for this wish list can be submitted by anyone.


THE WISH LIST
=============

* Mouse control configuration API
  2001-12-17  write-up by <mortene@sim.no>
  [upwards compatible extension]

  A request from coin-discuss: it should be possible for application
  programmers to change the default mousebutton combination
  configurations for dragging / zooming / panning for the
  So*ExaminerViewer, and likewise for the other viewer classes.
