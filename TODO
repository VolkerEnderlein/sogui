TODO
====

* [20000324:larsa]: Set up all files as .in templates because it's easier
  to untemplatify them into the build directory than to compile them from
  this one.

* [20000324:larsa]: Move ThumbWheel to SoAnyThumbWheel to conform with the
  rest of the system.


OTHER
=====

* common timer API

* dynamically programmable state-machine for managing the viewer states/modes
